TL;DR

Those specific names were examples—you don’t need them.

The snippet above auto-detects any neighborhood-like column in your file and standardizes to one neighborhood field so your forecast script runs unchanged.

You said:
no you're right these exist. Here is the issue analysis_neighborhood is a broader term like Tenderloin. neighborhoods_sffind_boundaries gives you a specific like Civic Center or Lower Nob Hill. When it looks at these names it then give sme a bunch of small neighborhoods
ChatGPT said:
Thought for 21s

Got it—you're seeing fragmentation because neighborhoods_sffind_boundaries is micro‑level while neighborhoods_analysis_boundaries is coarse. When blanks in the coarse column get backfilled from the micro column, you end up mixing vocabularies and your model explodes into lots of tiny neighborhoods.

What you want

Pick one grain (usually the Analysis Boundaries), and map all micro names to their parent before aggregating. Never mix.

Below is a drop‑in that:

Learns a parent mapping from SFFind → Analysis using rows where both exist.

Creates a single neighborhood column at the chosen grain.

(Optional) Collapses rare categories to Other (<parent>).

Writes the learned crosswalk to CSV so you can review.

You said:
let's remove district because these can include multiple nighborhoods. Everything should default to analysis_neighborhoods. Have it learn the analysis_neighborhoods from eighborhoods_sffind_boundaries if only eighborhoods_sffind_boundaries exists.  What is the best way to handle blanks? 
ChatGPT said:
Thought for 11s

Great call—let’s lock everything to the Analysis Boundaries vocabulary and stop the micro‑neighborhood explosion.

What you asked for

Remove district entirely ✅

Always default to neighborhoods_analysis_boundaries ✅

If analysis is missing but sffind exists, learn a mapping from SFFind → Analysis ✅

How to handle blanks ✅ (recommendations + options below)

Best practice for blanks

Blanks usually mean we don’t have enough spatial attribution to trust a neighborhood assignment. For a forecasting pipeline:

Safest (recommended): fill_blanks="Unknown"
Keeps those requests in the data but isolated as a separate group; they won’t pollute known neighborhoods. You can choose to drop or display “Unknown” in your UI.
